<p>The state of Goa, in India, is famous for its beaches and places of worship. Tourism is its primary industry, and is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland. The magical land of Goa is a land of celebrations and festivities. Snuggled in the Konkan Coast Belt, It has a long coastline of approx 100 kilometers. Goa is primarily known for its beautiful beaches which are engrossed with oscillating palm trees and an astonishing nightlife. It is a wonderful place embraced by joy & happiness only. However, apart from beaches there is much more in Goa. It is such a destination that combines the charm of the old world fashion with exoticism of the new age. The real beauty of Goa lies in its beautiful beaches, places of worship and world heritage architecture. It also has bountiful flora and fauna, owing to its location on the Western Ghat Range and it is classified as a biodiversity hotspot.
