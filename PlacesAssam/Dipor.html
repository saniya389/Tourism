Dipor Bil in Assamese translates to “Lake”, and this is a splendid one at that! The list of tourist places in Assam is never complete without mentioning the incredible Dipor Bil. Formed as an extension of the Brahmaputra river, this lake is situated 13 km southwest of Guwahati and is the perfect spot for birdwatching and basking in the sun. You’ll find all sorts of waterlilies, water hyacinths, aquatic grass, and other rare species of flora here that add a magical touch to this place and make it a favorite spot of couples and photographers. ‘Dipor Bil’ is a permanent, freshwater lake, in a former channel of the Brahmaputra river, to the south of the main river south-west of Guwahati city. It is a large natural wetland having great biological and environmental importance besides being the only major storm water storage basin for the Guwahati city. The beel is endowed with rich floral and faunal diversity.

It is also called a wetland under the Ramsar Convention which has listed the lake in November 2002, as a Ramsar Site for undertaking conservation measures on the basis of its biological and environmental importance.
