<p>The Rishikonda Beach also known as Rushikonda Beach is a stunning shore located on the coast of the Bay of Bengal in Vishakhapatnam, in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. APTDC, which is in charge of this natural beauty, has done a great job in the upkeep of the beach and ensured that this natural attraction remains unspoilt. The Rishikonda Beach is thus rightly named as the 'Jewel of the East Coast', owing to its essential and intact beauty. The serene golden sands of the beach are located in the bosom of the Rishikonda hill. 

Located in the midst of frothy blue sea and emerald greenery, the scenery that this beach boasts of is indeed mesmerising and breathtaking.
