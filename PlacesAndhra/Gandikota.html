<h2>"Grand Canyon of India"</h2>
<br/>
<div class="container">
<p>One of the lesser-known tourist spots in Andhra Pradesh, Gandikota has one major attraction that one should definitely witness. Home to the historic fort along the Penna river, this site has a view of the canyon, which is like none other. The vast canyon is also referred to as the “Grand Canyon of India.” The fort is a hub for campers who bring along tents and spend their night under a sky full of stars.
Endearingly known as the ‘Grand Canyon of India’, Gandikota is a twee village in Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh. Flanked by River Pennar on the right side, the village is popular for the spectacular gorges formed by the river cutting through Erramala Hills. The narrow valleys with streams running between them and the steep rocky walls to give them company remind one of the renowned Grand Canyon in Arizona. It requires a walk of almost a kilometre from the main gate to reach the boulder from where you can observe the mesmerising view from the viewpoint near the fort.
Located 1.5 hours away from Belum Caves, the highlight of the village of Gandikota are the ruins of Gandikota Fort which was built in the 13th Century. The sturdy fort is flanked by the Pennar gorges on both sides and is protected by a majestic 5-mile wall. Built in red sandstone, the fort boasts of beautiful, intricate carvings in the interior. It also offers sweeping views of the hills and valleys below. In addition to a granary, jail and ruins of some temples, there are several structures within the fort that you can visit.
